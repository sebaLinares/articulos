# git use cases explained w/ images

I don't have much working experience, but one thing I realized is that internet community is kind of a bubble. What you think is a well known subject because it talked every single day on social media, it's not on daily basis at work. One of the things I thought, before I entered the programming working force, was that everyone was a git expert and that it wasn't even worth talking about it, but how mistaken was I ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è. So here we go, 4 situations explained with images to fill those little cracks in your git knowledge.

One git command I'll use within this post is `git log --oneline --branches --remotes --graph` I will reffer to it as `git log awesome`. This will show you the short version of the commit, of every branch and remote branches + those lines and commit asterisks for visual queue. Remember it, and use it -for those projects with a large number of commits I add `--max-count 10` so I get only the last 10 commits üèÜ.

For sake of the explanations, the characters of this story are: Developer #1: makes commits in the `learning` directory **- LD = Learning Developer**. Developer #2: commits in the `projects` directory **- PD = Projects Developer**. 

1. Two developers trying to push changes to the same line of the same file.

The problem here goes for the second dev that tries to push. In this case it is PD. He will find this when he tries `git push`

The problem: PD wanted to change line 3 which was already changed and on origin/master. Thus, merge conflict. 

So what do we do?

First, you always need to read warnings git provides you. This one in particular tells you to do a git pull. **Personally** I never use pull. As I'm a typing fanatic I like to type as much as I can, lol, so I always fetch and then merge - `git pull === git fetch && git merge`. After that I use the `git log awesome` I told you at the beggining.

This shows us that beautiful graph that when you start understanding your like will git much easier - see what I did there? GIT much easier ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

I'll translate. Each `*` is a commit and each commit has a `SHA-1` - e.g `eb2f013`. This tells you that you - **HEAD** - are standing in `master` branch and you have the commit with the `65d57d6` sha-1, BUT that the **history** of this branch, diverges from the remote upstream branch of your local `master` branch - that is `origin/master`. Imagine that each one of those `|` is a path, can you see two paths? One points to `origin/master` and the other to `master`.
